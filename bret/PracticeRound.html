    You chose to collect {{ boxes_collected }} out of {{ C.NUM_BOXES }} boxes.

    <br/>
    The bomb was hidden behind the box in row {{ bomb_row }}, column {{ bomb_col }}.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    {{ if bomb }}
        The bomb was among your {{ boxes_collected }} collected boxes.<br/>
        Accordingly, all your earnings in this task were destroyed and your payoff amounts to {{ payoff }}.
    {{ else }}
        Your collected boxes did not contain the bomb.<br/>
        Thus, you receive {{ box_value }} for each of the {{ boxes_collected }} boxes
        you collected such that your payoff from this task amounts to <b>{{ payoff }}</b>
